        <p><font size = "6"> A <em><strong>sliding miter saw</strong></em> is a
            type of miter saw that adds rails to let the saw blade slide front to
            back across the wood. It gives you a much greater depth of cut than the same
            size miter saw without rails. Most sliding miter saws also include
            the ability to make a compound cut. </font></p>   

        <p><font size = "6"> A <em><strong>compound miter saw</strong></em> saw adds the ability to make bevel 
            cuts in addition to its mitering ability. You’ll want to make sure you have this 
            feature anytime you work with crown molding or other trim that gets installed on a wall. 
            Mitering occurs when you rotate the saw blade around a base. That base holds a scale that 
            tells you the miter angle in degrees. </font></p>            

        <p><font size = "6"> On a <em><strong>compound and sliding saw</strong></em> you get a miter table, sliding rails, 
            and beveling that goes both left and right. The left bevel eliminates the need to flip 
            your material around to make the opposite compound cut. This saves you some time and frustration. 
            If you prefer to make your crown and base molding cuts flat—this saw saves you lots of hassle 
            on longer pieces of material. </font></p>

        <h1>What to Consider When Choosing the Best Miter Saw</h1>

        <p><font size = "6"> <em><strong>Size and intended use-</strong></em> Saws are labeled by the size of blade they accept. In general, the larger the blade, 
            the larger the board the saw will cut. Not everyone needs the largest blade size—some prefer 
            a tool with a smaller blade because those tools are typically lighter in weight and simpler 
            to move (and often more accurate). A few off-sizes exist, but the most common miter saw blade 
            sizes are 7¼, 8½, 10, and 12 inches. </font></p>   

            <p><font size = "6"> <em><strong>Corded vs. Cordless-</strong></em> Until a few years ago, 
                all miter saws were corded, and most still are, but these cords limit where the saw can operate. 
                Cordless miter saws are the new kids on the block, and they operate on rechargeable lithium-ion 
                batteries. Battery runtime depends on the number of cuts and how thick the wood is, but expect 
                an average of 150 to 275 cuts on a single battery charge. </font></p>  

                <p><font size = "6"> <em><strong>Motor Power-</strong></em> The more power the saw’s motor 
                    has (measured in amperes), the longer the user can cut boards without the risk of overheating. 
                    Typical miter saw motor sizes are 10-amp, 12-amp, and 15-amp.

                    The larger motors will also generate enough blade-spinning force for cutting through thick, 
                    dense material. For example, if the user will be cutting only through pine boards, a 10-amp 
                    miter saw will likely offer more than enough power. However, a more powerful motor may be 
                    necessary for those who need to make repetitive cuts through fiber cement siding or oak stair 
                    treads. </font></p>  

                    <p><font size = "6"> <em><strong>Safety-</strong></em> A miter saw isn’t the most dangerous 
                        saw in the workshop, but it can still injure its user if misused or if it doesn’t come with 
                        safety features. The following safety features are standard on most of today’s miter saws. 
                    </font></p>
                    
                    <p><blockquote><font size = "5"> <em><strong>Blade guard-</strong></em> this is a clear cover 
                        that encases the spinning miter blade. When the user lowers the blade to cut, the 
                        guard rotates out of the way. When the user lifts the blade, the guard rotates back 
                        over the blade to cover it.</blockquote></p>

                        <p><blockquote><font size = "5"> <em><strong>Trigger brake-</strong></em> this is a clear cover 
                            that encases the spinning miter blade. When the user lowers the blade to cut, the 
                            guard rotates out of the way. When the user lifts the blade, the guard rotates back 
                            over the blade to cover it.</blockquote></p>
