        <p><font size = "5"> A <em><strong>sliding miter saw</strong></em> is a
            type of miter saw that adds rails to let the saw blade slide front to
            back across the wood. It gives you a much greater depth of cut than the same
            size miter saw without rails. Most sliding miter saws also include
            the ability to make a compound cut. </font></p>   

        <p><font size = "5"> A <em><strong>compound miter saw</strong></em> saw adds the ability to make bevel 
            cuts in addition to its mitering ability. You’ll want to make sure you have this 
            feature anytime you work with crown molding or other trim that gets installed on a wall. 
            Mitering occurs when you rotate the saw blade around a base. That base holds a scale that 
            tells you the miter angle in degrees. </font></p>            

        <p><font size = "5"> On a <em><strong>compound and sliding saw</strong></em> you get a miter table, sliding rails, 
            and beveling that goes both left and right. The left bevel eliminates the need to flip 
            your material around to make the opposite compound cut. This saves you some time and frustration. 
            If you prefer to make your crown and base molding cuts flat—this saw saves you lots of hassle 
            on longer pieces of material. </font></p>
