        <p>
            <font size="5"> <em><strong>Laser Guide-</strong></em> Some miter saws have laser 
                guides that mark a red or green line across the wood where the blade will cut. 
                This is an excellent feature for DIYers and beginners to ensure the board is 
                correctly positioned before cutting.</font>
        </p>

        <p>
            <font size="5"> <em><strong>Depth Stop-</strong></em> A miter saw that comes with a 
                depth stop allows the user to set the depth of the cutâ€”similar to a radial arm saw. 
                This allows the user to cut a groove in the material without cutting all the way through.</font>
        </p>

        <p>
            <font size="5"> <em><strong>Sliding Fence-</strong></em> Sliding fences are built into some miter 
                saws, and they pull out on both sides to allow the user to position the material securely 
                along the fence.</font>
        </p>

        <p>
            <font size="5"> <em><strong>Flip Fence-</strong></em> Flip fences come with locking stops, and the 
                user can lock two or more stops on the fence and simply flip them up and out of the way to cut 
                a different length. Flip fences are handy when the user needs to go back and forth between two 
                or more lengths when cutting boards.</font>
        </p>

        <p>
            <font size="5"> <em><strong>Non-slip Grip-</strong></em> Summer days can result in slippery grips 
                on a miter saw handle. Some manufacturers now offer padded nonslip grips to reduce hand fatigue 
                and allow for a better grasp.</font>
        </p>

        <p>
            <font size="5"> <em><strong>Dust Collection-</strong></em> Miter saws tend to kick up sawdust, 
                particularly when operated inside a workshop. To remedy this, two types of dust collection 
                are available for miter saws. The first is a small bag designed to collect some of the dust 
                that blows into it naturally as it comes off the blade. The second (and better) option is a 
                dust-collection port that connects to the hose of a shop-type vacuum.</font>
        </p>

        <p>
            <font size="5"> <em><strong>Stand-</strong></em> Many miter saws come with holes that allow 
                the user to bolt them to the workshop table for stability, but a few come with miter saw stands 
                that hold the saw securely when cutting.</font>

        <h1>Summary</h1>

        <p>
            <font size="5"> There are many things to consider when purchasing a miter saw.  
                It's important to weigh all options before breaking the bank.  Do you homework 
                to make the best informed decision.</font>
